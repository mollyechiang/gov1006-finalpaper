\ctable[caption={The Effect of Electoral Victory on Future Federal Government Contracts},label=raw.results.table,pos=htp,]{lccccc}{\tnote[]{Dependent variable is the log of the average value of contracts (plus one) received by a candidate's corporate donors, January 2008--September 2010. ``PT'' candidates are those from the ruling Worker's Party. ``Coalition'' candidates are those from the parties listed in footnote 12. The unlogged treatment effect is given by $exp(E[Y_{ij}(1)|M_{ij} =0]) - exp(E[Y_{ij}(0)|M_{ij} =0])$. ``Mean Donation'' is the estimated donation per firm for candidates at the discontinuity.  The loess specification uses a bandwidth of 40,000 votes and a span of 1. The local linear and polynomial specifications use bandwidths of 25,000 and 100,000 votes, respectively.  Loess standard errors are bootstrapped; others are heteroskedasticity-robust.}}{\FL
